Simple ATM Project (Sultan Ahmed)
How to Run This ATM Project:

Create a Folder: Create a new folder on your computer, for example, simple-atm.
Create Files: Inside this simple-atm folder, create three files:
index.html
style.css
script.js
Copy Code: Copy and paste the respective code blocks above into these files.
Open index.html: Open the index.html file in your web browser.
Features and How to Use:

Login: The ATM starts on the login screen. Enter 1234 as the PIN and click "Submit PIN" (or press Enter).
Main Menu: Once logged in, you'll see your current balance and options for Deposit, Withdraw, Check Balance, and Logout.
Deposit: Click "Deposit," enter an amount, and click "Deposit." The balance will update.
Withdraw: Click "Withdraw," enter an amount. If you have sufficient funds, the amount will be deducted. Otherwise, you'll get an "Insufficient funds" message.
Check Balance: This button simply takes you to a screen showing your balance in a larger font.
Logout: Returns you to the PIN entry screen.
Back Buttons: All transaction screens have a "Back to Main Menu" button.
Validation: Basic checks are in place for positive numeric inputs and sufficient balance for withdrawals.
Messages: Transaction and error messages are displayed below the input fields.
Important Notes for a Real-World ATM:

Security: This is a client-side simulation only. A real ATM would have a robust backend system (server, database) to store account information securely, process transactions, and handle authentication. Never store sensitive data like PINs or balances directly in client-side JavaScript in a real application.
Database: A real ATM connects to a central database to retrieve and update account balances.
Error Handling: More comprehensive error handling (e.g., network issues, invalid card) would be necessary.
Transaction History: A real ATM would store and display transaction history.
Concurrency: Handling multiple users accessing the same account simultaneously is a complex issue in real banking systems.
Hardware Integration: Real ATMs interact with physical hardware like card readers, cash dispensers, and receipt printers.
